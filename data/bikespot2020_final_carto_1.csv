I have seen drivers exiting Charman Rd (travelling north to south) to turn west onto Beach Road (towards Cliff Gve) swerve into the cycle lane and have 'near misses' with cyclists in the lane. Really bad drivers do this with excessive speed. They don't care if their vehicle needs a larger turning arc because of their speed. Being in the bike lane riding east to west on Beach Road when a driver from Charman wants to turn onto Beach road in the same direction you're pedalling is hairy. Drivers aren't looking at cyclists in the bike lane coming from the east. They're looking at traffic from the west. When they shoot across 2 lanes of traffic with speed, they don't realise how their vehicle swings into the bike lane. Regular riders should have Cycliq/dashcam footage of this. Sorry I don't.","David Gordon: I frequently ride through this intersection too, between 3 and 6 times a week. There are dangers for Beach Rd bike riders travelling west-east and east-west.
My perception is that dangers are much worse when riding west-east. This is by far the most dangerous point for bike riders on the Beach Rd training route between St Kilda and Mordialloc. The road Narrows on approach to the Charman Rd intersection, motor traffic is hemmed in by a concrete median strip, and the painted bike lane Narrows as well. 
It is common when passing through here to find vehicles parallel parked beside the kerb. The parked vehicles force riders into conflict with passing motor vehicles travelling west-east. Some passing vehicles wish to turn left into Charman Rd and pass dangerously close to the front wheel of bike riders instead of waiting behind the bike rider to execute their turn.
Cars turning right into Beach Rd from Charman Rd frequently fail to give way to bike riders and other traffic travelling west-east.
If car parking was prohibited on Beach Rd 150m either side of this intersection it would be much safer for bike riders.
When riding east-west I have had fewer unfavourable interactions with motor vehicles. I have not witnessed terrifying incidents where vehicles turning right into Beach Rd from Charman at high speed that the comment above describes but it is not difficult to imagine. 
My worst experiences at this intersection when riding east-west occur when passing slower riders or riding two abreast in the Narrow painted bike lane. When doing so it is common to receive aggressive treatment (horn blaring, dangerously close overtaking or swooping) from passing motorists.
Experienced riders brace themselves when passing through this intersection. For inexperienced cyclists riding through the Charman Rd intersection would be terrifying. Passing though here on a bike has been a nasty experience for many years. Modification of the intersection to make it safer for bike riders is long overdue. 
However, one safety change has already made a big difference at this intersection. Before trucks were banned from Beach Rd just about every time I rode through here west-east I suffered frighteningly close interactions with trucks. It was uncanny. Why did trucks always pass me there? With most trucks now gone from Beach Rd I am scared witless much less frequently at Charman Rd. Thank you for banning trucks from Beach Rd!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
